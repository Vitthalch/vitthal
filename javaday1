1.	Mention the difference between interpreter and compiler
Ans.	Interpreter
		- Interpreter takes only one line of code at a time
		- There is no Byte code
		- It is slower than Compiler
		- If there is any Error all errors in the program will be displayed at a time
		- Memory requirement is less
		- Examples: Python
	Compiler
		- Compiler takes total program at a time
		- There is a Byte code
		- It is faster than Interpreter
		- If there is any Error they will be displayed after each line of program
		- Memory requirement is more
		- Example: C, C++, Java
